# lorenz-vis
Simple visualisation which allowed users to interact with the Lorenz system of differential equations

#  Libraries Used

peasycam - [http://mrfeinberg.com/peasycam/](http://mrfeinberg.com/peasycam/)
controlP5 - [http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/) 

# User Control

- User can move around the visualisation.
- Left click lets user rotate the camera
- Scroll and right click allow user to zoom the camera in and out
- Middle click allows user to pan the camera

- Preset buttons resets the simulation and uses a different preset value of sigma, rho and beta
- Sliders allow you to change values of sigma, rho and beta and "update values" resets the simulation and uses your desired values of sigma, rho and beta.

**- Playback buttons**
- "Quick mode" increases the framerate to speed up the simulation (if PC can run it), increases CPU usage
- "Normal mode" sets framerate back to 60
- "Reset" resets simulation and camera placement
- "Pause" and "Play" pauses and resumes the creation of points in the simulation

- Press "s" to save a screenshot
- Press "r" to reset the cameras orientation
